a. what part of the error message gave you a clue

    Syntax Error in line 27.
    
b. how you set about solving the issue (e.g.: I Googled)

    Line 27 is a conditional statement, so using = instead of == won't work.
    
c. summarize what you learned.

    Always remember to know the difference between == (equals) and = (assignment).
